JdeRobot-Academy is a ROS-based framework for learning robotics in a practical way, open source and multiplatform. It is oriented to engineering students and Python. It provides a collection of exercises similar to successful robotics applications (autonomous cars, vacuum cleaners, logistics, drones...). For each exercise supplies a ROS node which hosts the student's code, hides the communication with robot drivers and shows a Graphical User Interface. The student has a simple HAL-API to get sensor readings and set actuator commands, and has a GUI-API to interact with GUI for debugging. It works with simulated robots in Gazebo and with real ones.
